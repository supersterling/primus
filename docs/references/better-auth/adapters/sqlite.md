# SQLite

Integrate Better Auth with SQLite.

SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine that is widely used for local data storage in applications.
Read more [here.](https://www.sqlite.org/)

## Example Usage

Better Auth supports multiple SQLite drivers. Choose the one that best fits your environment:

### Better-SQLite3 (Recommended)

The most popular and stable SQLite driver for Node.js:

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import Database from "better-sqlite3";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: new Database("database.sqlite"),
});
```

  For more information, read Kysely's documentation to the
  [SqliteDialect](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/classes/SqliteDialect.html).

### Node.js Built-in SQLite (Experimental)

  The `node:sqlite` module is still experimental and may change at any time. It requires Node.js 22.5.0 or later.

Starting from Node.js 22.5.0, you can use the built-in [SQLite](https://nodejs.org/api/sqlite.html) module:

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { DatabaseSync } from "node:sqlite";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: new DatabaseSync("database.sqlite"),
});
```

To run your application with Node.js SQLite:

```bash
node your-app.js
```

### Bun Built-in SQLite

You can also use the built-in [SQLite](https://bun.com/docs/api/sqlite) module in Bun, which is similar to the Node.js version:

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";
export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: new Database("database.sqlite"),
});
```

## Schema generation & migration

The [Better Auth CLI](/docs/concepts/cli) allows you to generate or migrate
your database schema based on your Better Auth configuration and plugins.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr className="border-b">
      <th>
          SQLite Schema Generation
      </th>

      <th>
          SQLite Schema Migration
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr className="h-10">
      <td>
        ✅ Supported
      </td>

      <td>
        ✅ Supported
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

```bash
    npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

```bash
    pnpm dlx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

```bash
    yarn dlx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

```bash
    bun x @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

```bash
    npx @better-auth/cli@latest migrate
```

```bash
    pnpm dlx @better-auth/cli@latest migrate
```

```bash
    yarn dlx @better-auth/cli@latest migrate
```

```bash
    bun x @better-auth/cli@latest migrate
```

## Joins (Experimental)

Database joins is useful when Better-Auth needs to fetch related data from multiple tables in a single query.
Endpoints like `/get-session`, `/get-full-organization` and many others benefit greatly from this feature,
seeing upwards of 2x to 3x performance improvements depending on database latency.

The Kysely SQLite dialect supports joins out of the box since version `1.4.0`.
To enable this feature, you need to set the `experimental.joins` option to `true` in your auth configuration.

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
  experimental: { joins: true }
});
```

  It's possible that you may need to run migrations after enabling this feature.

## Additional Information

SQLite is supported under the hood via the [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/) adapter, any database supported by Kysely would also be supported. ([Read more here](/docs/adapters/other-relational-databases))
