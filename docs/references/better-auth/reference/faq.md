Frequently asked questions about Better Auth.

This page contains frequently asked questions, common issues, and other helpful information about Better Auth.

    When encountering `createAuthClient` related errors, make sure to have the correct import path as it varies based on environment.

    If you're using the auth client on react front-end, you'll need to import it from `/react`:

```ts
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";
```

    Where as if you're using the auth client in Next.js middleware, server-actions, server-components or anything server-related, you'll likely need to import it from `/client`:

```ts
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
```

    If you try to call `authClient.getSession` on a server environment (e.g, a Next.js server component), it doesn't work since it can't access the cookies. You can use the `auth.api.getSession` instead and pass the request headers to it.

```tsx
    import { auth } from "./auth";
    import { headers } from "next/headers";

    const session = await auth.api.getSession({
        headers: await headers()
    })
```

    if you need to use the auth client on the server for different purposes, you still can pass the request headers to it:

```tsx
    import { authClient } from "./auth-client";
    import { headers } from "next/headers";

    const session = await authClient.getSession({
        fetchOptions:{
          headers: await headers()
        }
    })
```

    If you need to configure a corporate proxy for Better Auth's outbound requests (e.g., OAuth provider requests), you can use undici's ProxyAgent to set up a global fetch proxy.

```typescript
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
    import { ProxyAgent, setGlobalDispatcher } from "undici";

    const proxyAgent = new ProxyAgent("http://your-proxy.example.com:8080");
    setGlobalDispatcher(proxyAgent);

    export const auth = betterAuth({
      // your configuration
    });
```

    Since Better Auth runs on the server side, you have full control over Node.js's fetch behavior through undici's global dispatcher. This approach allows all outbound requests from Better Auth to go through your corporate proxy.

      Learn more about undici ProxyAgent in the [undici documentation](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/blob/main/docs/docs/api/ProxyAgent.md).

    Better Auth provides a type-safe way to extend the user and session schemas, take a look at our docs on [extending core schema](/docs/concepts/database#extending-core-schema).

    Both `useSession` and `getSession` instances are used fundamentally different based on the situation.

    `useSession` is a hook, meaning it can trigger re-renders whenever session data changes.

    If you have UI you need to change based on user or session data, you can use this hook.

      For performance reasons, do not use this hook on your `layout.tsx` file. We
      recommend using RSC and use your server auth instance to get the session data
      via `auth.api.getSession`.

    `getSession` returns a promise containing data and error.

    For all other situations where you shouldn't use `useSession`, is when you should be using `getSession`.

      `getSession` is available on both server and client auth instances.
      Not just the latter.

    If you're facing typescript errors, make sure your tsconfig has `strict` set to `true`:

```json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "strict": true,
      }
    }
```

    if you can't set strict to true, you can enable strictNullChecks:

```json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "strictNullChecks": true,
      }
    }
```

    You can learn more in our [TypeScript docs](/docs/concepts/typescript#typescript-config).

    At this time, you can't remove the `name`, `image`, or `email` fields from the user table.

    We do plan to have more customizability in the future in this regard, but for now, you can't remove these fields.

    If you're encountering errors like:

```
    No request state found. Please make sure you are calling this function within a `runWithRequestState` callback.
```

    This is typically caused by a **dual module hazard** - when multiple versions of `better-auth` or `@better-auth/core` exist in your dependency tree. This commonly occurs after upgrading to v1.4+, especially in Cloudflare Workers, Nuxt, or when using plugins like `oauthProvider`.

    ### How to Diagnose

    Check if you have duplicate versions of Better Auth packages:

```bash
    # For pnpm users
    pnpm why @better-auth/core
    pnpm why better-auth

    # For npm users
    npm ls @better-auth/core
    npm ls better-auth

    # For yarn users
    yarn why @better-auth/core
    yarn why better-auth
```

    If you see multiple versions listed, you have a dual module hazard.

    ### How to Fix

    #### Basic Steps

    Start by ensuring your dependencies are clean and all Better Auth packages use compatible versions.

      **Clean reinstall:**

```bash
      # Remove node_modules and lockfile
      rm -rf node_modules
      rm pnpm-lock.yaml # or package-lock.json or yarn.lock

      # Reinstall dependencies
      pnpm install # or npm install or yarn install
```

      Check your `package.json` and make sure all Better Auth related packages (`better-auth`, `@better-auth/core`, `@better-auth/oauth-provider`, etc.) are using compatible versions.

    #### Package Manager Resolution Issues

    If you're using Yarn v1 (Classic) or potentially other package managers like pnpm v9, you may need to force `better-call` to resolve to a single instance.

      **For Yarn v1 / pnpm v9 users:**

      Manually install `better-call` and add it to both `dependencies` and `resolutions` to force it to be hoisted to the top level:

```json
      {
        "dependencies": {
          "better-call": "^1.1.8",
          // ... other dependencies
        },
        "resolutions": {
          "better-call": "^1.1.8"
        }
      }
```

      Then reinstall your dependencies:

```bash
      yarn install # or pnpm install
```

      Note: Yarn v3 and pnpm v10 don't typically have this issue.

      **Important:** Make sure to install `better-auth` and related packages in `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`.

    #### Bundler Resolution Issues

    This is a bundler-level issue where the same module gets resolved to different instances. The goal is to make your bundler resolve the module to the same instance.

      **For Next.js users:**

      Add `better-auth` to `serverExternalPackages` in your `next.config.js`:

```ts
      const config = {
        serverExternalPackages: ['better-auth']
      };
```

      **For Cloudflare Workers users:**

      Make sure you have the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag enabled in your `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
      compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
```

    #### Verify the Fix

    Run the diagnostic commands again to confirm only one version of each package exists:

```bash
    pnpm why @better-auth/core
    pnpm why better-auth
    pnpm why better-call
```

    You should see only one version listed for each package.
