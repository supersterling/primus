Salesforce provider setup and usage.

    ### Get your Salesforce Credentials

    1. Log into your Salesforce org (Production or Developer Edition)
    2. Navigate to **Setup > App Manager**
    3. Click **New Connected App**
    4. Fill in the basic information:
       * Connected App Name: Your app name
       * API Name: Auto-generated from app name
       * Contact Email: Your email address
    5. Enable OAuth Settings:
       * Check **Enable OAuth Settings**
       * Set **Callback URL** to your redirect URI (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/salesforce` for development)
       * Select Required OAuth Scopes:
         * Access your basic information (id)
         * Access your identity URL service (openid)
         * Access your email address (email)
         * Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh\_token, offline\_access)
    6. Enable **Require Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)** (required)
    7. Save and note your **Consumer Key** (Client ID) and **Consumer Secret** (Client Secret)

      * For development, you can use `http://localhost:3000` URLs, but production requires HTTPS
      * The callback URL must exactly match what's configured in Better Auth
      * PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is required by Salesforce and is automatically handled by the provider

      For sandbox testing, you can create the Connected App in your sandbox org, or use the same Connected App but specify `environment: "sandbox"` in the provider configuration.

    ### Configure the provider

    To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

```ts
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        socialProviders: {
            salesforce: {
                clientId: process.env.SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID as string,
                clientSecret: process.env.SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
                environment: "production", // or "sandbox"
            },
        },
    })
```

    #### Configuration Options

    * `clientId`: Your Connected App's Consumer Key
    * `clientSecret`: Your Connected App's Consumer Secret
    * `environment`: `"production"` (default) or `"sandbox"`
    * `loginUrl`: Custom My Domain URL (without `https://`) - overrides environment setting
    * `redirectURI`: Override the auto-generated redirect URI if needed

    #### Advanced Configuration

```ts
    export const auth = betterAuth({
        socialProviders: {
            salesforce: {
                clientId: process.env.SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID as string,
                clientSecret: process.env.SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
                environment: "sandbox",
                loginUrl: "my-company.my.salesforce.com", // Custom My Domain
                redirectURI: "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/salesforce", // Override if needed
            },
        },
    })
```

      * Use `environment: "sandbox"` for testing with Salesforce sandbox orgs
      * The `loginUrl` option is useful for organizations with My Domain enabled
      * The `redirectURI` option helps resolve redirect URI mismatch errors

    ### Environment Variables

    Add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
    SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID=your_consumer_key_here
    SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_consumer_secret_here
    BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Important for redirect URI generation
```

    For production:

```bash
    SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID=your_consumer_key_here
    SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_consumer_secret_here
    BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

    ### Sign In with Salesforce

    To sign in with Salesforce, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:

    * `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `salesforce`.

```ts
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    const authClient = createAuthClient()

    const signIn = async () => {
        const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
            provider: "salesforce"
        })
    }
```

    ### Troubleshooting

    #### Redirect URI Mismatch Error

    If you encounter a `redirect_uri_mismatch` error:

    1. **Check Callback URL**: Ensure the Callback URL in your Salesforce Connected App exactly matches your Better Auth callback URL
    2. **Protocol**: Make sure you're using the same protocol (`http://` vs `https://`)
    3. **Port**: Verify the port number matches (e.g., `:3000`)
    4. **Override if needed**: Use the `redirectURI` option to explicitly set the redirect URI

```ts
    salesforce: {
        clientId: process.env.SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID as string,
        clientSecret: process.env.SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
        redirectURI: "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/salesforce",
    }
```

    #### Environment Issues

    * **Production**: Use `environment: "production"` (default) with `login.salesforce.com`
    * **Sandbox**: Use `environment: "sandbox"` with `test.salesforce.com`
    * **My Domain**: Use `loginUrl: "yourcompany.my.salesforce.com"` for custom domains

    #### PKCE Requirements

    Salesforce requires PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) which is automatically handled by this provider. Make sure PKCE is enabled in your Connected App settings.

      The default scopes requested are `openid`, `email`, and `profile`. The provider will automatically include the `id` scope for accessing basic user information.
