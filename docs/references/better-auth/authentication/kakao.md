# Kakao

Kakao provider setup and usage.

    ### Get your Kakao Credentials

    To use Kakao sign in, you need a client ID and client secret. You can get them from the [Kakao Developer Portal](https://developers.kakao.com).

    Make sure to set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/kakao` for local development. For production, you should set it to the URL of your application. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.

    ### Configure the provider

    To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

      * The default scopes are `account_email`, `profile_image`, and `profile_nickname`.
      * Note that retrieving `account_email` requires the app to be a **Biz App** (an app that has completed business verification). For more details, refer to the [Kakao Login scopes documentation](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/kakaologin/utilize#scope-user).

```ts
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        socialProviders: {
            kakao: {
                clientId: process.env.KAKAO_CLIENT_ID as string,
                clientSecret: process.env.KAKAO_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
            },
        }
    })
```

    ### Sign In with Kakao

    To sign in with Kakao, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:

    * `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `kakao`.

```ts
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    const authClient =  createAuthClient()

    const signIn = async () => {
        const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
            provider: "kakao"
        })
    }
```
