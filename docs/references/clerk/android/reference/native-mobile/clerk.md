# Clerk

`Clerk` is the main entry point for the SDK. After you [`configure the SDK`](https://clerk.com/docs/android/reference/native-mobile/configuration.md), you can access it in two ways:

## Access user state

Use `Clerk.userFlow` to reactively observe the current user:

```kotlin
import com.clerk.api.Clerk

// In a ViewModel or Composable
val user by Clerk.userFlow.collectAsState(initial = null)

if (user != null) {
    Text("Welcome, ${user.firstName}")
} else {
    Text("Please sign in")
}
```

## Access the Clerk instance

Access authentication methods through the global `Clerk` object:

```kotlin
import com.clerk.api.Clerk

// Sign in
Clerk.auth.signInWithPassword {
    identifier = "user@email.com"
    password = "secretpassword"
}

// Sign out
Clerk.auth.signOut()
```
