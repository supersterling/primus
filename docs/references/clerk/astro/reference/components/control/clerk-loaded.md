# <ClerkLoaded>

The `<ClerkLoaded>` component guarantees that the Clerk object has loaded (the `status` is `'ready'` or `'degraded'`) and will be available under `window.Clerk`. This allows you to wrap child components to access the `Clerk` object without the need to check it exists.

## Example

It's not recommended to wrap the entire app in the `<ClerkLoaded>` component; instead, only wrap the components that need access to the `Clerk` object.

> Unlike other Clerk components for Astro, `<ClerkLoaded>` must be imported from `@clerk/astro/react`. This requires that your Astro app is set up with React. See [`Use Clerk with Astro and React`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/astro/react.md) for guidance.

```astro {{ filename: 'index.astro' }}
---
import { ClerkLoaded } from '@clerk/astro/react'
---

<ClerkLoaded client:load>
  <p>Clerk has loaded</p>
</ClerkLoaded>
```
