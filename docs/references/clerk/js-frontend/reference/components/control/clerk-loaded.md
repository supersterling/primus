# <ClerkLoaded>

The `<ClerkLoaded>` component guarantees that the Clerk object has loaded (the `status` is `'ready'` or `'degraded'`) and will be available under `window.Clerk`. This allows you to wrap child components to access the `Clerk` object without the need to check it exists.

## Usage with JavaScript

The following methods available on an instance of the [`Clerk`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/javascript/clerk.md) class is used to render and control the `<ClerkLoaded />` component:

- [`load()`](https://clerk.com/docs/js-frontend/reference/components/control/clerk-loaded.md#load)

The following examples assume that you have followed the [`quickstart`](https://clerk.com/docs/js-frontend/getting-started/quickstart.md) in order to add Clerk to your JavaScript application.

### `load()`

Render the `<ClerkLoaded>` component to an HTML `<div>` element.

```typescript
function load(options?: ClerkOptions): Promise<void>
```

#### `ClerkOptions`

The `load()` method accepts an optional object that accepts the following props. All props are optional.
