# <SignUp /> component

The `<SignUp />` component renders a UI for signing up users. The functionality of the `<SignUp />` component is controlled by the instance settings you specify in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), such as [sign-in and sign-up options](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options.md) and [social connections](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/social-connections/overview.md). You can further customize your `<SignUp />` component by passing additional [`properties`](https://clerk.com/docs/js-frontend/reference/components/authentication/sign-up.md#properties) at the time of rendering. The `<SignUp />` component also displays any session tasks that are required for the user to complete after signing up.

> The `<SignUp/>` and `<SignIn/>` components cannot render when a user is already signed in, unless the application allows multiple sessions. If a user is already signed in and the application only allows a single session, Clerk will redirect the user to the Home URL instead.

## Usage with JavaScript

The following methods available on an instance of the [`Clerk`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/javascript/clerk.md) class are used to render and control the `<SignUp />` component:

- [`mountSignUp()`](https://clerk.com/docs/js-frontend/reference/components/authentication/sign-up.md#mount-sign-up)
- [`unmountSignUp()`](https://clerk.com/docs/js-frontend/reference/components/authentication/sign-up.md#unmount-sign-up)
- [`openSignUp()`](https://clerk.com/docs/js-frontend/reference/components/authentication/sign-up.md#open-sign-up)
- [`closeSignUp()`](https://clerk.com/docs/js-frontend/reference/components/authentication/sign-up.md#close-sign-up)

The following examples assume that you have followed the [`quickstart`](https://clerk.com/docs/js-frontend/getting-started/quickstart.md) in order to add Clerk to your JavaScript application.

### `mountSignUp()`

Render the `<SignUp />` component to an HTML `<div>` element.

```typescript
function mountSignUp(node: HTMLDivElement, props?: SignUpProps): void
```

#### `mountSignUp()` params

| Name   | Type           | Description                                                    |
| ------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| node   | HTMLDivElement | The <div> element used to render in the <SignUp /> component |
| props? | SignUpProps    | The properties to pass to the <SignUp /> component.           |

#### `mountSignUp()` usage

```typescript {{ filename: 'main.ts', mark: [15] }}
import { Clerk } from '@clerk/clerk-js'

// Initialize Clerk with your Clerk Publishable Key
const clerkPubKey = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

const clerk = new Clerk(clerkPubKey)
await clerk.load()

document.getElementById('app').innerHTML = `
  <div id="sign-up"></div>
`

const signUpDiv = document.getElementById('sign-up')

clerk.mountSignUp(signUpDiv)
```

### `unmountSignUp()`

Unmount and run cleanup on an existing `<SignUp />` component instance.

```typescript
function unmountSignUp(node: HTMLDivElement): void
```

#### `unmountSignUp()` params

| Name | Type           | Description                                                                 |
| ---- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| node | HTMLDivElement | The container <div> element with a rendered <SignUp /> component instance |

#### `unmountSignUp()` usage

```typescript {{ filename: 'main.ts', mark: [19] }}
import { Clerk } from '@clerk/clerk-js'

// Initialize Clerk with your Clerk Publishable Key
const clerkPubKey = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

const clerk = new Clerk(clerkPubKey)
await clerk.load()

document.getElementById('app').innerHTML = `
  <div id="sign-up"></div>
`

const signUpDiv = document.getElementById('sign-up')

clerk.mountSignUp(signUpDiv)

// ...

clerk.unmountSignUp(signUpDiv)
```

### `openSignUp()`

Opens the `<SignUp />` component as an overlay at the root of your HTML `body` element.

```typescript
function openSignUp(props?: SignUpProps): void
```

#### `openSignUp()` params

| Name   | Type        | Description                                         |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| props? | SignUpProps | The properties to pass to the <SignUp /> component |

#### `openSignUp()` usage

```js {{ filename: 'main.js', mark: [9] }}
import { Clerk } from '@clerk/clerk-js'

// Initialize Clerk with your Clerk Publishable Key
const clerkPubKey = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

const clerk = new Clerk(clerkPubKey)
await clerk.load()

clerk.openSignUp()
```

### `closeSignUp()`

Closes the sign up overlay.

```typescript
function closeSignUp(): void
```

#### `closeSignUp()` usage

```js {{ filename: 'main.js', mark: [13] }}
import { Clerk } from '@clerk/clerk-js'

// Initialize Clerk with your Clerk Publishable Key
const clerkPubKey = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

const clerk = new Clerk(clerkPubKey)
await clerk.load()

clerk.openSignUp()

// ...

clerk.closeSignUp()
```

Once the sign-up is complete, the value of this field will be automatically copied to the created user's unsafe metadata (User.unsafeMetadata). One common use case is to collect custom information about the user during the sign-up process and store it in this property. Read more about unsafe metadata. |

## Customization

To learn about how to customize Clerk components, see the [`customization documentation`](https://clerk.com/docs/js-frontend/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/overview.md).

If Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview.md).
