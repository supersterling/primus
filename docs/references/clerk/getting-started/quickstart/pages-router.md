# Next.js Quickstart (Pages Router)

**Example Repository**

- [Next.js Pages Router Quickstart Repo](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-nextjs-pages-quickstart)

**Before you start**

- [Set up a Clerk application](https://clerk.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/setup-clerk.md)

1. ## Create a new Next.js app

   If you don't already have a Next.js app (Pages Router), run the following commands to [create a new one](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/getting-started/installation).

   ```npm
   npm create next-app@latest clerk-nextjs-pages -- --no-app
   cd clerk-nextjs-pages
   npm install
   ```
2. ## Install `@clerk/nextjs`

   The [`Clerk Next.js SDK`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nextjs/overview.md) gives you access to prebuilt components, hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

   Run the following command to install the SDK:

   ```npm
   npm install @clerk/nextjs
   ```
3. ## Set your Clerk API keys

   Add the following keys to your `.env` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

   1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page.
   2. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk Publishable Key and Secret Key.
   3. Paste your keys into your `.env` file.

   The final result should resemble the following:

   ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
   ```
4. ## Add `clerkMiddleware()` to your app

   [`clerkMiddleware()`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware.md) grants you access to user authentication state throughout your app. It also allows you to protect specific routes from unauthenticated users. To add `clerkMiddleware()` to your app, follow these steps:

   > If you're using Next.js ≤15, name your file `middleware.ts` instead of `proxy.ts`. The code itself remains the same; only the filename changes.

   1. Create a `proxy.ts` file.
      - If you're using the `/src` directory, create `proxy.ts` in the `/src` directory.
      - If you're not using the `/src` directory, create `proxy.ts` in the root directory alongside `.env`.
   2. In your `proxy.ts` file, export the `clerkMiddleware()` helper:

      ```tsx {{ filename: 'proxy.ts' }}
      import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

      export default clerkMiddleware()

      export const config = {
        matcher: [
          // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
          '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
          // Always run for API routes
          '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
        ],
      }
      ```
   3. By default, `clerkMiddleware()` will not protect any routes. All routes are public and you must opt-in to protection for routes. See the [`clerkMiddleware() reference`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware.md) to learn how to require authentication for specific routes.
5. ## Add `<ClerkProvider>` to your app

   The [`<ClerkProvider>`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/clerk-provider.md) component provides session and user context to Clerk's hooks and components. It's recommended to wrap your entire app at the entry point with `<ClerkProvider>` to make authentication globally accessible. See the [`reference docs`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/clerk-provider.md) for other configuration options.

   Add the `<ClerkProvider>` component to your app, as shown in the following example:

   ```tsx {{ filename: 'pages/_app.tsx', mark: [2, [7, 12], 14] }}
   import '@/styles/globals.css'
   import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
   import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

   function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
     return (
       <ClerkProvider
         {...pageProps}
         appearance={{
           cssLayerName: 'clerk',
         }}
       >
         <Component {...pageProps} />
       </ClerkProvider>
     )
   }

   export default MyApp
   ```
6. ## Update `globals.css`

   In the previous step, the `cssLayerName` property is set on the `<ClerkProvider>` component. Now, you need to **add the following line to the top of your `globals.css` file** in order to include the layer you named in the `cssLayerName` property. The example names the layer `clerk` but you can name it anything you want. These steps are necessary for v4 of Tailwind as it ensures that Tailwind's utility styles are applied after Clerk's styles.

   ```css {{ filename: 'globals.css' }}
   + @layer theme, base, clerk, components, utilities;
     @import 'tailwindcss';
   ```
7. ## Create a header with Clerk components

   You can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with the [`prebuilt control components`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/overview.md#control-components). The following example creates a header using the following components:

   - [`<SignedIn>`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/control/signed-in.md): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
   - [`<SignedOut>`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/control/signed-out.md): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.
   - [`<UserButton />`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/user/user-button.md): Shows the signed-in user's avatar. Selecting it opens a dropdown menu with account management options.
   - [`<SignInButton />`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/unstyled/sign-in-button.md): An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page. In this example, since no props or [environment variables](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/clerk-environment-variables.md) are set for the sign-in URL, this component links to the [Account Portal sign-in page](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/account-portal/overview.md#sign-in).
   - [`<SignUpButton />`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/unstyled/sign-up-button.md): An unstyled component that links to the sign-up page. In this example, since no props or [environment variables](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/clerk-environment-variables.md) are set for the sign-up URL, this component links to the [Account Portal sign-up page](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/account-portal/overview.md#sign-up).

   ```tsx {{ filename: 'pages/_app.tsx', mark: [[4, 8], [20, 34]] }}
   import '@/styles/globals.css'
   import {
     ClerkProvider,
     SignInButton,
     SignUpButton,
     SignedIn,
     SignedOut,
     UserButton,
   } from '@clerk/nextjs'
   import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

   function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
     return (
       <ClerkProvider
         {...pageProps}
         appearance={{
           cssLayerName: 'clerk',
         }}
       >
         <header className="flex justify-end items-center p-4 gap-4 h-16">
           {/* Show the sign-in and sign-up buttons when the user is signed out */}
           <SignedOut>
             <SignInButton />
             <SignUpButton>
               <button className="bg-[#6c47ff] text-white rounded-full font-medium text-sm sm:text-base h-10 sm:h-12 px-4 sm:px-5 cursor-pointer">
                 Sign Up
               </button>
             </SignUpButton>
           </SignedOut>
           {/* Show the user button when the user is signed in */}
           <SignedIn>
             <UserButton />
           </SignedIn>
         </header>
         <Component {...pageProps} />
       </ClerkProvider>
     )
   }

   export default MyApp
   ```
8. ## Run your project

   Run your project with the following command:

   ```npm
   npm run dev
   ```
9. ## Create your first user

   1. Visit your app's homepage at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
   2. Select "Sign up" on the page and authenticate to create your first user.
