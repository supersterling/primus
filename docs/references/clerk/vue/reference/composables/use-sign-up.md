# useSignUp() | Vue

The `useSignUp()` composable provides access to the [`SignUp`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/javascript/sign-up.md) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-up attempt and manage the sign-up flow. You can use this to create a custom sign-up flow.

## How to use the `useSignUp()` composable

### Check the current state of a sign-up

The following example uses the `useSignUp()` hook to access the [`SignUp`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/javascript/sign-up.md) object, which contains the current sign-up attempt status and methods to create a new sign-up attempt. The `isLoaded` property is used to handle the loading state.

```vue {{ filename: 'SignUpStep.vue' }}
<script setup>
import { useSignUp } from '@clerk/vue'

const { isLoaded, signUp } = useSignUp()
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="!isLoaded">
    <!-- Handle loading state -->
  </div>

  <div v-else>The current sign-up attempt status is {{ signUp?.status }}.</div>
</template>
```
