# Add Bitbucket as a social connection

**Before you start**

- [A Clerk app is required.](https://clerk.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/setup-clerk.md)
- [A Bitbucket account is required.](https://bitbucket.org/account/signup)

Enabling OAuth with [Bitbucket](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/oauth-2) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their Bitbucket account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
2. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
3. Select **Bitbucket** from the provider list.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Bitbucket Workspaces](https://bitbucket.org/account/workspaces/) page.

1. ### Enable Bitbucket as a social connection in Clerk

   1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
   2. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
   3. Select **Bitbucket** from the provider list.
   4. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
   5. Save the **Callback URL** somewhere secure. Keep this page open.
2. ### Create a Bitbucket OAuth Consumer

   1. On a separate page, go to the [Bitbucket Workspaces](https://bitbucket.org/account/workspaces/) page and sign in.
   2. Under **Workspaces**, find your workspace and select **Manage**.
   3. In the sidenav, scroll down and select **OAuth consumers**.
   4. Select **Add consumer**.
   5. Complete the required fields. In  **Permissions** , under **Account**, select **Email** and **Read**.
   6. Select **Save**. You'll be redirected to the **OAuth consumers** page.
   7. Select your consumer and save the **Key** and **Secret** values somewhere secure.
3. ### Set the Key and Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

   1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where the configuration page should still be open. Paste the **Key** and **Secret** values that you saved into the respective fields.
   2. Select **Save**.

   > If the page is no longer open, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, paste the values into their respective fields.
4. ### Test your connection

   The simplest way to test your connection is to visit your Clerk app's [Account Portal](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/account-portal/overview.md), which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.

   1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/account-portal) page.
   2. Next to **Sign-in**, select the button to visit the sign-in page. The URL should resemble:
      - **For development** - `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
      - **For production** - `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`
   3. Sign in with your connection's credentials.
