# Add Facebook as a social connection

**Before you start**

- [A Clerk app is required.](https://clerk.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/setup-clerk.md)
- [A Meta Developer account is required.](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/register)

Enabling OAuth with Facebook allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Facebook account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
2. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
3. Select **Facebook** from the provider list.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Facebook Developer](https://developers.facebook.com) page.

1. ### Enable Facebook as a social connection

   1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
   2. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
   3. Select **Facebook** from the provider list.
   4. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
   5. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep this page open.
2. ### Create a Facebook app

   1. In the top-right of the Facebook Developer page, select [**My Apps**](https://developers.facebook.com/apps).
   2. In the top-right, select **Create App**. You'll be redirected to the **Create an app** process.
      1. In the **App details** step, fill out the necessary information and select **Next**.
      2. In the **Use Cases** step, select **Authenticate and request data from users with Facebook Login** and then select **Next**.
      3. In the **Business** step, select the business portfolio to connect to your app and then select **Next**.
      4. In the **Finalize** step, select **Go to dashboard**. You'll be redirected to the app's **Dashboard** page.
   3. In the left sidenav, select **Use cases**.
   4. Next to **Authenticate and request data from users with Facebook Login**, select **Customize**. You'll be redirected to the **Permissions** tab of the **Customize use case** page.
   5. Next to **email**, select **Add**. This permission allows Clerk to read your user's primary email address.
   6. In the left sidenav, under **Facebook Login**, select **Settings**.
   7. In the **Client OAuth settings** section, in the **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs** field, paste the **Redirect URI** value you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
   8. Select **Save changes**.
   9. In the left sidenav, select **App settings** (hover over the settings icon to view the title or expand the menu), and then select **Basic**.
   10. Save the **App ID** and **App Secret** somewhere secure.
3. ### Set the App ID and App Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

   1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where the configuration page should still be open. Paste the **App ID** and **App Secret** values that you saved into the respective fields.
   2. Select **Save**.

   > If the page is no longer open, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, you can paste the values into their respective fields.
4. ### Test your connection

   The simplest way to test your connection is to visit your Clerk app's [Account Portal](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/account-portal/overview.md), which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.

   1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/account-portal) page.
   2. Next to **Sign-in**, select the button to visit the sign-in page. The URL should resemble:
      - **For development** - `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
      - **For production** - `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`
   3. Sign in with your connection's credentials.
