# Build a sign-in flow with Clerk Elements

**Before you start**

- [Follow the Next.js quickstart](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/getting-started/quickstart.md)
- [Upgrade to Core 2 (if necessary)](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/upgrading/upgrade-guides/core-2/nextjs.md)
- [Install Clerk Elements](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/elements/overview.md#getting-started)

> Clerk Elements is no longer in development and will not receive any updates. We're actively building a replacement for Clerk Elements with a different approach to customization, and we'll share more details soon.

> - Clerk Elements is for [advanced use-cases](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/elements/overview.md#why-use-clerk-elements) that require a high-level of customization. The easiest way to implement Clerk is with our [`all-in-one UI components`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/overview.md).
> - Clerk Elements currently only works with Next.js App Router and [Clerk Core 2](https://clerk.com/changelog/2024-04-19){{ target: '_blank' }}.

1. ## Add a sign-in route

   Create a new route in your Next.js application. The route needs to be an [optional catch-all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-segments) so the sign-in flow can handled nested paths, as shown in the following example:

   ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx' }}
   'use client'

   import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
   import * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'

   export default function SignInPage() {
     return <SignIn.Root>[Sign In Root]</SignIn.Root>
   }
   ```

   You will use these two imports to build out the rest of the flow. `<SignIn.Root>` manages the sign-in state and handles connecting the components to Clerk's APIs.

   > If you're getting TypeScript errors on the `@clerk/elements` imports you probably have forgotten to set your [`moduleResolution`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#moduleResolution) in `tsconfig.json` to `bundler`.
2. ## Add the start step

   The Clerk authentication flows are made up of **steps**. Steps handle rendering the UI for each part of the flow. To allow users to create a sign-in attempt, the `start` step needs to be rendered. The following example does so with the `<SignIn.Step>` component:

   ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx', mark: [[9, 11]] }}
   'use client'

   import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
   import * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'

   export default function SignInPage() {
     return (
       <SignIn.Root>
         <SignIn.Step name="start">
           <h1>Sign in to your account</h1>
         </SignIn.Step>
       </SignIn.Root>
     )
   }
   ```
3. ## Add form fields

   Make it functional by adding input fields. The following example uses the `<Clerk.Field>` component to render an `identifier` field, as well as the `<Connection>` component to allow users to sign in with a social connection, like Google:

   ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx', mark: [[12, 20]] }}
   'use client'

   import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
   import * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'

   export default function SignInPage() {
     return (
       <SignIn.Root>
         <SignIn.Step name="start">
           <h1>Sign in to your account</h1>

           <Clerk.Connection name="google">Sign in with Google</Clerk.Connection>

           <Clerk.Field name="identifier">
             <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>
             <Clerk.Input />
             <Clerk.FieldError />
           </Clerk.Field>

           <SignIn.Action submit>Continue</SignIn.Action>
         </SignIn.Step>
       </SignIn.Root>
     )
   }
   ```

   `<Clerk.Field>` takes care of wiring up the input with the label element, and `<Clerk.FieldError>` will render any field-specific errors that get returned from Clerk's API. The `<SignIn.Action>` component provides common actions that are used throughout the flows. In this case, using the `submit` action to render a submit button for the start form.

   > If your Clerk instance supports signing in with Google and doesn't require multi-factor authentication (MFA), you should be able to complete a sign-in with the components rendered so far.
4. ## Add verification

   As users progress through a sign-in attempt, they may be asked to **verify** a number of authentication factors in the `verifications` step. You can render a form for the user to complete verification, but each [verification strategy](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/elements/reference/sign-in.md#strategy) requires different fields. You must render the form fields conditionally for each authentication strategy your instance supports using the `<SignIn.Strategy>` component.

   The following example demonstrates how to conditionally render a form for the `email_code` strategy:

   ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx', mark: [[23, 38]] }}
   'use client'

   import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
   import * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'

   export default function SignInPage() {
     return (
       <SignIn.Root>
         <SignIn.Step name="start">
           <h1>Sign in to your account</h1>

           <Clerk.Connection name="google">Sign in with Google</Clerk.Connection>

           <Clerk.Field name="identifier">
             <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>
             <Clerk.Input />
             <Clerk.FieldError />
           </Clerk.Field>

           <SignIn.Action submit>Continue</SignIn.Action>
         </SignIn.Step>

         <SignIn.Step name="verifications">
           <SignIn.Strategy name="email_code">
             <h1>Check your email</h1>
             <p>
               We sent a code to <SignIn.SafeIdentifier />.
             </p>

             <Clerk.Field name="code">
               <Clerk.Label>Email code</Clerk.Label>
               <Clerk.Input />
               <Clerk.FieldError />
             </Clerk.Field>

             <SignIn.Action submit>Continue</SignIn.Action>
           </SignIn.Strategy>
         </SignIn.Step>
       </SignIn.Root>
     )
   }
   ```

   Verification is the final step in the sign-in flow. When a user has verified all required factors, the sign-in attempt will be complete and they will be signed in.
5. ## Add password support

   If your instance is configured to support authenticating with passwords, you must add a few additional steps and verification strategies. You can choose if you want to support providing a password in the `start` step with an additional field, or as an additional verification strategy. For this guide, add it as a standalone verification strategy.

   ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx', mark: [[39, 65], [68, 94]] }}
   'use client'

   import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
   import * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'

   export default function SignInPage() {
     return (
       <SignIn.Root>
         <SignIn.Step name="start">
           <h1>Sign in to your account</h1>

           <Clerk.Connection name="google">Sign in with Google</Clerk.Connection>

           <Clerk.Field name="identifier">
             <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>
             <Clerk.Input />
             <Clerk.FieldError />
           </Clerk.Field>

           <SignIn.Action submit>Continue</SignIn.Action>
         </SignIn.Step>

         <SignIn.Step name="verifications">
           <SignIn.Strategy name="email_code">
             <h1>Check your email</h1>
             <p>
               We sent a code to <SignIn.SafeIdentifier />.
             </p>

             <Clerk.Field name="code">
               <Clerk.Label>Email code</Clerk.Label>
               <Clerk.Input />
               <Clerk.FieldError />
             </Clerk.Field>

             <SignIn.Action submit>Continue</SignIn.Action>
           </SignIn.Strategy>

           <SignIn.Strategy name="password">
             <h1>Enter your password</h1>

             <Clerk.Field name="password">
               <Clerk.Label>Password</Clerk.Label>
               <Clerk.Input />
               <Clerk.FieldError />
             </Clerk.Field>

             <SignIn.Action submit>Continue</SignIn.Action>
             <SignIn.Action navigate="forgot-password">Forgot password?</SignIn.Action>
           </SignIn.Strategy>

           <SignIn.Strategy name="reset_password_email_code">
             <h1>Check your email</h1>
             <p>
               We sent a code to <SignIn.SafeIdentifier />.
             </p>

             <Clerk.Field name="code">
               <Clerk.Label>Email code</Clerk.Label>
               <Clerk.Input />
               <Clerk.FieldError />
             </Clerk.Field>

             <SignIn.Action submit>Continue</SignIn.Action>
           </SignIn.Strategy>
         </SignIn.Step>

         <SignIn.Step name="forgot-password">
           <h1>Forgot your password?</h1>

           <SignIn.SupportedStrategy name="reset_password_email_code">
             Reset password
           </SignIn.SupportedStrategy>

           <SignIn.Action navigate="previous">Go back</SignIn.Action>
         </SignIn.Step>

         <SignIn.Step name="reset-password">
           <h1>Reset your password</h1>

           <Clerk.Field name="password">
             <Clerk.Label>New password</Clerk.Label>
             <Clerk.Input />
             <Clerk.FieldError />
           </Clerk.Field>

           <Clerk.Field name="confirmPassword">
             <Clerk.Label>Confirm password</Clerk.Label>
             <Clerk.Input />
             <Clerk.FieldError />
           </Clerk.Field>

           <SignIn.Action submit>Reset password</SignIn.Action>
         </SignIn.Step>
       </SignIn.Root>
     )
   }
   ```

   To enable users to reset their passwords, you can add the following additional steps:

   1. `forgot-password` –  Renders [`<SignIn.SupportedStrategy>`](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/elements/reference/sign-in.md#supported-strategy), which initiates the reset process, whereby an email code is sent to the user for verification.
      - `<SignIn.SupportedStrategy>` is also used in the `forgot-password` and `choose-strategy` steps to trigger verification of a supported strategy.
   2. `reset-password` – Allows a verified user to input a new password. If your instance has been set up to accept SMS codes, you can also use `reset_password_phone_code`.

   > If your instance isn't configured to use passwords, or any of the strategies outlined here, Clerk Elements will log a warning to the console during development.
