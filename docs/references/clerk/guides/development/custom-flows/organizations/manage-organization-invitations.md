# Build a custom flow for creating and managing Organization invitations

> This guide is for users who want to build a custom flow. To use a _prebuilt_ UI, use the [Account Portal pages](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/account-portal/overview.md) or [`prebuilt components`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/components/overview.md).

Organization members with appropriate [Permissions](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions.md) can invite new users to their Organization and manage those invitations. The invitation recipient can be either an existing user of your application or a new user. If they are a new user, they will need to sign up in order to accept the invitation.

Users with the appropriate Permissions can also revoke Organization invitations for users that have not yet joined, which will prevent the user from becoming an Organization member.

This guide will demonstrate how to use the Clerk API to build a custom flow for inviting users to an Organization and managing an Organization's pending invitations.

> This guide is for creating and managing Organization invitations client-side. You can also create an Organization invitation using the Backend API. See the [Organization invitations reference](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/invitations.md) for more information.
>
> Also, see the [custom flow for accepting Organization invitations](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/organizations/accept-organization-invitations.md).

To invite a user:

1. Use the [`useOrganization()`](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/reference/hooks/use-organization.md) hook to get `organization`, which is the Active Organization's.
2. Use `organization` to call the [`inviteMember()`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/javascript/organization.md#invite-member) method, with the recipient's email address and desired Role passed as arguments.

To revoke an invitation:

1. Use the `useOrganization()` hook to get `invitations`, which is a list of invitations for the Active Organization's.
2. `invitations` is an array of [`OrganizationInvitation`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/javascript/types/organization-invitation.md) objects. Each `OrganizationInvitation` object has a [`revoke()`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/javascript/types/organization-invitation.md#revoke) method that can be called to revoke the invitation.

The following example includes:

- An `<InviteMember />` component that allows administrators to invite new members to their Organization.
- An `<InvitationList />` component that lists all pending invitations and allows administrators to revoke them.

**This example is written for Next.js App Router but it can be adapted for any React-based framework, such as React Router or Tanstack React Start.**

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/components/InvitationList.tsx', collapsible: true }}

## Next steps

Now that you've created a flow for managing Organization invitations, you might want to create a flow for accepting invitations. See the [dedicated custom flow guide](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/organizations/accept-organization-invitations.md) for more information.
