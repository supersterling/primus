# Integrate Shopify with Clerk

**Before you start**

- [Set up a Clerk application](https://clerk.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/setup-clerk.md)
- [Create a Shopify store](https://www.shopify.com/)

This tutorial outlines how to integrate Clerk's authentication with your Shopify Plus store, allowing you to use Clerk as your identity provider for customer logins. In Shopify, using [your own Identity Provider for customer login](https://changelog.shopify.com/posts/use-your-own-identity-provider-for-customer-login) is only available to stores on the **Shopify Plus plan**.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Shopify admin](https://admin.shopify.com).

1. ## Create a new Clerk OAuth application

   1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**OAuth applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/oauth-applications) page.
   2. Select **Add OAuth application**. A modal will open.
   3. Enter the **Name** of your new OAuth application.
   4. For the **Scopes**, ensure to select `openid`. The following scopes should be enabled: `openid`, `email`, and `profile`.
   5. Select **Add**. You'll be presented with the **Client Secret**.
   6. Select **Copy secret** and save the value somewhere secure. You'll be redirected to the OAuth app's settings page.
   7. Under **Application Credentials**, copy and save the **Client ID** somewhere secure.
   8. Under **Application Configuration URLs**, copy and save the **Discovery URL** somewhere secure. Keep this page open.
2. ## Connect a new Shopify provider

   1. In a new tab, navigate to your [Shopify admin](https://admin.shopify.com).
   2. In the left sidenav, select **Settings**. You'll be redirected to your shop's **General** settings page.
   3. In the left sidenav, select **Customer accounts**. You'll be redirected to the **Customer accounts** page.
   4. Next to **Identity provider**, select **Manage**. You'll be redirected to the **Identity provider** page.
      > In Shopify, using [your own Identity Provider for customer login](https://changelog.shopify.com/posts/use-your-own-identity-provider-for-customer-login) is only available to stores on the Shopify Plus plan.
   5. Select **Connect to provider**. You'll be redirected to the **Connect to identity provider** page.
   6. Fill in the required fields. Paste the **Discovery URL**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** that you previously copied from Clerk Dashboard.
   7. In the **Additional scopes** field, enter `profile`.
   8. In the **Post-logout redirect URI parameter name** field, enter `returnTo`.
   9. Select **Save** at the top of the page to update your Identity Provider's configuration.
   10. In the top right, select **Activate** to enable your new Identity Provider.
   11. Under **Setup configurations**, copy and save the **Callback URL** somewhere secure.
   12. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard and paste the **Callback URL** into the **Redirect URIs** field.
   13. Select **Save** to update your Clerk OAuth application's configuration.
