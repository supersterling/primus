# ClerkApp

> The Remix SDK is in maintenance mode and will only receive security updates. Please migrate to the [`React Router SDK`](https://clerk.com/docs/react-router/getting-started/quickstart.md) for continued development and new features.

Clerk provides a `ClerkApp` wrapper to provide the authentication state to your React tree. This helper works with Remix SSR out-of-the-box and follows the "higher-order component" paradigm.

## Usage

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/root.tsx' }}
// The rest of your code

function App() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <Meta />
        <Links />
      </head>
      <body>
        <Outlet />
        <ScrollRestoration />
        <Scripts />
        <LiveReload />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}

// Wrap your app with `ClerkApp`
export default ClerkApp(App)
```

## Pass configuration options

To pass configuration [`options`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/remix/clerk-app.md#clerk-app-options) to `ClerkApp`, you can pass an optional argument to the `ClerkApp` function.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/root.tsx' }}
// Wrap your app in ClerkApp(app)
export default ClerkApp(App, {
  publishableKey: import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY,
})
```

For example, { 'choose-organization': '/onboarding/choose-organization' } redirects users to /onboarding/choose-organization after sign-up if they need to choose an organization.                     |
| telemetry                         | false | { disabled: boolean; debug: boolean } | undefined | Controls whether or not Clerk will collect telemetry data. If set to debug, telemetry events are only logged to the console and not sent to Clerk.                                                                                                                                                                       |

This option allows you to disable this behavior.                                                                                                                                                    |
