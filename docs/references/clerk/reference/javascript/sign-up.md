## Methods

### `attemptEmailAddressVerification()`

Attempts to verify an email address by validating the OTP provided by the user against the code sent during the prepare verification step. This is a convenience method that wraps [`SignUp.attemptVerification()`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/javascript/sign-up.md#attempt-verification) with the `'email_code'` strategy.

By default, this method is equivalent to calling `SignUp.attemptVerification({ strategy: 'email_code', code })`. The verification attempt will fail if the code is invalid or has expired.

```typescript
function attemptEmailAddressVerification(
  params: AttemptEmailAddressVerificationParams,
): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

#### `AttemptEmailAddressVerificationParams`

| Name | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| code | string | The OTPA one-time password (OTP) is a code that is used to authenticate a user. The OTP is typically sent to a user's email address or phone number and must be entered within a certain time period to be valid. that was sent to the user via email. |

### `attemptPhoneNumberVerification()`

Attempts to verify a phone number by validating the OTP provided by the user against the OTP sent during the prepare verification step. This is a convenience method that wraps [`SignUp.attemptVerification()`](#attempt-verification) with the `'phone_code'` strategy.

By default, this method is equivalent to calling `SignUp.attemptVerification({ strategy: 'phone_code', code })`. The verification attempt will fail if the OTP is invalid or has expired.

```typescript
function attemptPhoneNumberVerification(
  params: AttemptPhoneNumberVerificationParams,
): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

#### `AttemptPhoneNumberVerificationParams`

| Name | Type   | Description                                 |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| code | string | The code that was sent to the user via SMS. |

### `attemptVerification()`

Attempts to complete a pending verification process for the specified verification strategy. This method must be called after initiating verification via [`SignUp.prepareVerification()`](#prepare-verification). The verification attempt will validate the provided verification parameters (code, signature, etc.) against the pending verification request.

Depending on the strategy, the method parameters could differ.

```typescript
function attemptVerification(params: AttemptVerificationParams): Promise<SignUp>
```

The signature that was sent to the user via the Web3 verification strategy.                                         |

### `attemptWeb3WalletVerification()`

Attempts to verify a Web3 wallet address by validating the cryptographic signature generated by the wallet against the nonce provided during the prepare verification step. This is a convenience method that wraps [`SignUp.attemptVerification()`](#attempt-verification) with Web3 wallet strategies.

By default, this method is equivalent to calling `SignUp.attemptVerification({ strategy: 'web3_metamask_signature', signature })`. The verification attempt will fail if the signature is invalid or the nonce has expired.

```typescript
function attemptWeb3WalletVerification(params: AttemptWeb3WalletVerificationParams): Promise<SignUp>
```

#### `AttemptWeb3WalletVerificationParams`

```js
await clerk.signUp.authenticateWithPopup({
  popup: window.open('https://example.com', '_blank'),
  strategy: 'oauth_google',
  redirectUrl: '/sso-callback',
  redirectUrlComplete: '/home',
})
```

### `authenticateWithWeb3()`

Initiates a Web3 authentication flow by verifying the user's ownership of a blockchain wallet address through cryptographic signature verification. This method enables decentralized authentication without requiring traditional credentials.

> When the `strategy` is `web3_solana_signature`, the `walletName` parameter must be specified to indicate which Solana wallet provider to use for the authentication process.

```typescript
function authenticateWithWeb3(params: AuthenticateWithWeb3Params): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

#### Example

```js

})
```

### `create()`

Returns a new `SignUp` object based on the `params` you pass to it, stores the sign-up lifecycle state in the `status` property, and deactivates any existing sign-up process the client may already have in progress. Use this method to initiate a new sign-up process.

What you must pass to `params` depends on which [sign-up options](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options.md) you have enabled in your Clerk application instance.

Optionally, you can complete the sign-up process in one step if you supply the required fields to `create()`. Otherwise, Clerk's sign-up process provides great flexibility and allows users to easily create multi-step sign-up flows.

> Once the sign-up process is complete, pass the `createdSessionId` to the [`setActive()`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/javascript/clerk.md#set-active) method on the `Clerk` object. This will set the newly created session as the active session.

```typescript
function create(params: SignUpCreateParams): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

### `createEmailLinkFlow()`

```typescript
function createEmailLinkFlow(): {
  startEmailLinkFlow: (params: StartEmailLinkFlowParams) => Promise<SignUp>
  cancelEmailLinkFlow: () => void
}
```

Sets up a sign-up with email link flow. Calling `createEmailLinkFlow()` will return two functions.

The first function is async and starts the email link flow, preparing an email link verification. It sends the email link email and starts polling for verification results. The signature is `startEmailLinkFlow({ redirectUrl: string }) => Promise<SignUpResource>`.

The second function can be used to stop polling at any time, allowing for full control of the flow and cleanup. The signature is `cancelEmailLinkFlow() => void`.

```typescript
function createEmailLinkFlow(): {
  startEmailLinkFlow: (params: StartEmailLinkFlowParams) => Promise<SignUpResource>
  cancelEmailLinkFlow: () => void
}
```

#### `createEmailLinkFlow()` returns

`createEmailLinkFlow` returns an object with two functions:

| Name               | Type                                                   | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| startEmailLinkFlow | (params: StartEmailLinkFlowParams) => Promise<SignUp> | Function to start the email link flow. It prepares an email link verification and polls for the verification result. |

#### `StartEmailLinkFlowParams`

| Name        | Type   | Description                                                                      |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| redirectUrl | string | The full URL that the user will be redirected to when they visit the email link. |

### `prepareEmailAddressVerification()`

Initiates an email verification process by sending a OTP to the email address associated with the current sign-up attempt. This is a convenience method that wraps [`SignUp.prepareVerification()`](#prepare-verification) with the `'email_code'` strategy.

By default, this method is equivalent to calling `SignUp.prepareVerification({ strategy: 'email_code' })`. It can be customized via the `PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams` to use alternative verification strategies like email links.

```typescript
function prepareEmailAddressVerification(
  params?: PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams,
): Promise<SignUpResource>

### `preparePhoneNumberVerification()`

Initiates a phone number verification process by sending an OTP via SMS to the phone number associated with the current sign-up attempt. This is a convenience method that wraps [`SignUp.prepareVerification()`](#prepare-verification) with the `'phone_code'` strategy.

By default, this method is equivalent to calling `SignUp.prepareVerification({ strategy: 'phone_code' })`. The verification process will fail if the phone number is invalid, unreachable, or has already been verified. The sent verification code has a limited validity period and can only be used once.

```typescript
function preparePhoneNumberVerification(
  params?: PreparePhoneNumberVerificationParams,
): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

### `prepareWeb3WalletVerification()`

Initiates a verification process for a Web3 wallet by sending the wallet address to the server and retrieving a nonce that must be cryptographically signed by the wallet. This is a convenience method that wraps [`SignUp.prepareVerification()`](#prepare-verification) with Web3 wallet strategies.

By default, this method is equivalent to calling `SignUp.prepareVerification({ strategy: 'web3_metamask_signature' })`. The verification process will fail if the wallet address is invalid or has already been verified. The returned nonce has a limited validity period and can only be used once.

### `update()`

Updates the current `SignUp`.

```typescript
function update(params: SignUpUpdateParams): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

#### `SignUpUpdateParams`

`SignUpUpdateParams` is a mirror of [`SignUpCreateParams`](#sign-up-create-params) with the same fields and types, depending on the configuration of the instance.

### `upsert()`

Conditionally creates or updates the current sign-up. If a sign-up with an ID exists, it will update that sign-up. Otherwise, it will create a new sign-up.

```typescript
function upsert(params: SignUpCreateParams | SignUpUpdateParams): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

#### Example

```js
const signUp = await clerk.signUp.upsert({
  emailAddress: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'secure-password',
})
```
