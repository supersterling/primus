# PhoneNumber

The `PhoneNumber` object describes a phone number. Phone numbers can be used as a proof of identification for users, or simply as a means of contacting users.

Phone numbers must be **verified** to ensure that they can be assigned to their rightful owners. The `PhoneNumber` object holds all the necessary state around the verification process.

The verification process consists of two steps:

- The verification process always starts with the [`prepareVerification()`](#prepare-verification) method, which will send an OTP via an SMS message.
- The second and final step involves an attempt to complete the verification by calling the [`attemptVerification()`](#attempt-verification) method, passing the OTP as a parameter.

Finally, phone numbers can be used as part of [multi-factor authentication](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options.md#multi-factor-authentication). During sign in, users can opt in to an extra verification step where they will receive an SMS message with an OTP. This OTP must be entered to complete the sign in process.

> SMS functionality, including SMS OTPs, is restricted to phone numbers from countries that are enabled on your [SMS allowlist](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options.md#sms-allowlist). This can be useful for avoiding extraneous SMS fees from countries from which your app is not expected to attract traffic. **By default, only the US and Canada are enabled.**

```

### `destroy()`

Deletes this phone number.

```typescript
function destroy(): Promise<void>
```

### `toString()`

```typescript
function attemptVerification(params: AttemptPhoneNumberVerificationParams): Promise<PhoneNumber>
```

### `AttemptPhoneNumberVerificationParams`

### `makeDefaultSecondFactor()`

Marks this phone number as the default second factor for [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options.md#multi-factor-authentication). A user can have exactly one default second factor.

```typescript
function makeDefaultSecondFactor(): Promise<PhoneNumber>
```

### `setReservedForSecondFactor()`

Marks this phone number as reserved for [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options.md#multi-factor-authentication) or not.

```typescript
function setReservedForSecondFactor(params: SetReservedForSecondFactorParams): Promise<PhoneNumber>
```

#### `SetReservedForSecondFactorParams`

| Name     | Type    | Description                                                                                             |
