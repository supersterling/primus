## Available methods

All available methods are listed in the [Ruby SDK documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-ruby?tab=readme-ov-file#available-resources-and-operations){{ target: '_blank' }}, which provides a more Ruby-friendly interface.

### Reverification

The reverification feature provides an additional layer of security by requiring users to reverify their session before accessing sensitive routes. By default, it is set to `STRICT`, but accepts the following presets:

- `Clerk::StepUp::Preset::LAX`: Authenticated within the past day, requiring the second factor
- `Clerk::StepUp::Preset::MODERATE`: Authenticated within the past hour, requiring the second factor
- `Clerk::StepUp::Preset::STRICT`: Authenticated within the past 10 minutes, requiring the second factor
- `Clerk::StepUp::Preset::STRICT_MFA`: Authenticated within the past 10 minutes, requiring both first factors and second factors
