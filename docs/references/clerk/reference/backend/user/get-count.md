## Examples

> Using `clerkClient` varies based on your framework. Refer to the [`JS Backend SDK overview`](https://clerk.com/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart.md) for usage details, including guidance on [`how to access the userId and other properties`](https://clerk.com/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart.md#get-the-user-id-and-other-properties).

### Basic

```tsx
const response = await clerkClient.users.getCount()
```

### Filter by query

The following example retrieves the total number of users matching the query `test`.

```tsx
const response = await clerkClient.users.getCount({ query: 'test' })
```

### Filter by last sign-in date

Retrieve the total number of users that signed in within a specific time range.

```tsx
const response = await clerkClient.users.getCount({
  lastSignInAtAfter: 1700690400000,
  lastSignInAtBefore: 1700690400010,
})
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/users/count`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/users/get/users/count.md){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
