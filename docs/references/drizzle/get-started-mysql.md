# Drizzle \<\> MySQL

To use Drizzle with a MySQL database, you should use the `mysql2` driver

According to the **[official website](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2)**, 
`mysql2` is a MySQL client for Node.js with focus on performance.  

Drizzle ORM natively supports `mysql2` with `drizzle-orm/mysql2` package.

#### Step 1 - Install packages
```bash
npm install drizzle-orm mysql2
```
```bash
npm install -D drizzle-kit
```

#### Step 2 - Initialize the driver and make a query
```typescript
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/mysql2";

const db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL);

const response = await db.select().from(...)
```
```typescript
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/mysql2";

// You can specify any property from the mysql2 connection options
const db = drizzle({ connection:{ uri: process.env.DATABASE_URL }});

const response = await db.select().from(...)
```

If you need to provide your existing driver:

```typescript
  import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/mysql2";
  import mysql from "mysql2/promise";

  const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
    host: "host",
    user: "user",
    database: "database",
    ...
  });

  const db = drizzle({ client: connection });
```
```typescript
  import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/mysql2";
  import mysql from "mysql2/promise";

  const poolConnection = mysql.createPool({
    host: "host",
    user: "user",
    database: "database",
    ...
  });

  const db = drizzle({ client: poolConnection });
```

> **Warning:** For the built in `migrate` function with DDL migrations we and drivers strongly encourage you to use single `client` connection.
> For querying purposes feel free to use either `client` or `pool` based on your business demands.
